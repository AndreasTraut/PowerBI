## "Bicycle Count" report:
This small and highly interactive PowerBI example shows the count of bicycles passing 6 distinct places in Munich and the weather (rain, min. and max. temperature) on each day.

Techniques implemented: <br>
‚û°Ô∏èreading 12 daily csv files and 12 more deailled csv files and joining the csv files into two datasets with PowerQuery<br>
‚û°Ô∏ècreating a flexible, non-static "places-Dimension" table and a calendar with hierarchies<br>
‚û°Ô∏èdefining relationships between the two datasets and the places-dimension-table and the calendar in Tabular Editor<br>
‚û°Ô∏èdefining DAX measures: total, average, min, max<br>
‚û°Ô∏ècreating line and barplot and filters on places and calendar in PowerBI Desktop<br>

Datasource: https://opendata.muenchen.de/dataset/daten-der-raddauerzaehlstellen-muenchen-2022 (OpenData)<br>

I published my PowerBI report via novyPro, which is a nice platform for data analysts and where you can immediately work with the report (without installing anything):

## "Superstore Sales" report in PowerBI

This is a report for analyzing the sales data of a supermarket. The report contains three pages: Report page "Overview" compares the regions/states and gives indications about the development in the different states/cites and categories (e.g. Technology), subcategories and segments (Consumer, Corporate, Home).  Reporting page "Time Analysis" reveals more information on the development and contains also trends (absolute and relative) compared to the previous year. The third reporting page "Customer Analysis" compares all costumers.

Techniques implemented:<br>
‚û°Ô∏èCreating a customized calender with a CSX Script in Tabular Editor (which uses min and max of the Ship-Date of the dataset)<br>
‚û°Ô∏èDefining measures using DAX (abs./rel. trends and totals) and hierarchies (e.g. for Region/State/City) and calculated columns (Customer&ID). <br>
‚û°Ô∏èUsing different kinds of interactive visuals (bar, line, maps, treemap) to analyze the data. Please click on the visuals and see how the other reveal more information about your selected item. <br>
‚û°Ô∏èContains "Color Coding" for trends and stars for customers.<br>

## "Onyx Data Challenge": Youtube report in PowerBI

This is my participation for the "Onyx Dataset Challenge" as of November 2023. My PowerBI report contains: 
‚û°Ô∏èData cleaning in PowerQuery. Scaling of measures (like "Population" in millions). Creating "Created Data" column. <br>
‚û°Ô∏èSplitting of raw dataset into a country dimension and a fact dataset. <br>
‚û°Ô∏èBuilding a very simple datamodel with country dimension and fact dataset.<br>
‚û°Ô∏èCreating different DAX measures (max, min, average, sum, ...). <br>
‚û°Ô∏èImplementing a customer friendly possibility to scale the measures (like highest earning) in Thousand/K or Millions/M by using DAX calculation group. <br>
‚û°Ô∏èBuilding highly interactive tables for analyzing country and youtubers using maps, cards, filters creation time, categories and channel types.<br>

The model has 24 MB, 5 Tables, 63 columns. Calculation time for the whole report in total is about 180ms for formula engine. The remaining time is mostly rendering and waiting for other visuals to complete.

üëâ Please click somewhere in the tables and see how the others interact!<br>
üëâ Use the "sort by" possibility to navigate through the data.
